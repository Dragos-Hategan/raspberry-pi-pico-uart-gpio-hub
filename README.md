# Raspberry Pi Pico: UART GPIO Hub

> **Multi-client UART-based GPIO control system** for Raspberry Pi Pico, with persistent flash state and automatic UART connection detection.

This project enables a central **Pico-based server** to detect and communicate with multiple **Pico-based clients** over UART. Clients expose GPIOs that can be remotely controlled (ON/OFF/TOGGLE) by the server via UART messages. The server saves the state of all connected devices in its internal Flash memory, allowing full device state restoration after power cycles.

## System Overview

* Server auto-detects all valid TX/RX pin combinations via UART handshake.
* Each client listens for GPIO control commands and applies them.
* Server sends state updates and stores them in persistent Flash.

---

## Features

* Automatic UART handshake
* Scans all Raspberry Pi Pico's UART0 & UART1 pin pairs (up to 5 clients)
* Remote GPIO control
* Server tracks all client states, supports:

  * ON / OFF Device
  * TOGGLE Device
  * SAVE active config
  * BUILD preset config
  * LOAD preset into active config
  * 5 PRESET configurations per client
* Persistent flash memory with CRC32 protection
* Menu-based USB CLI interface for live control
* Power Saving For Clients

---

## How It Works

1. Server powers on and scans UART pin pairs.
2. Client powers on and broadcasts handshake.
3. On success:

   * Server saves connection
   * Server can control client GPIOs
4. States saved to Flash with CRC32.
5. On reboot, handshake runs again and states are restored automatically.

## UART Protocol

### Handshake

```
Client → Server : "Requesting Connection-[TX,RX]"
Server → Client : "[TX,RX]"
Client → Server : "[Connection Accepted]"
```

### Command Format

```
Server → Client : "[gpio_number,value]"
Example: "[2,1]" → turn GPIO 2 ON
OR
Server → Client : "[FLAG,FLAG]"
Example: "[WAKE_UP_FLAG_NUMBER,WAKE_UP_FLAG_NUMBER]" → confirm dormant wakeup
```

## Requirements

* Any Raspberry Pi Pico boards (1 server, 1-5 clients)
* [Pico SDK](https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk)
* CMake
* Arm GCC toolchain
* Make/Ninja or `nmake` (depending on platform)

---

## Toolchain & SDK Setup Guide

Follow these steps once to set up your environment for all Pico C/C++ projects.

### Windows

#### 1. Install ARM GCC

- Download from: [Arm GNU Toolchain Downloads](https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/arm-gnu-toolchain-downloads)
- Install to: `C:\arm-gcc` (for example)
* Add to PATH during installation or after

#### 2. Install CMake

* [https://cmake.org/download/](https://cmake.org/download/)
* Add to PATH during installation or after

#### 3. Install Make tool (**recommended: NMake via Visual Studio**)

> Best option: use **NMake**, included with **Visual Studio Developer Command Prompt**  
> You don’t need to install anything else if you build from this environment.

> Optional alternative (MinGW):
- Install **MSYS2**: [https://www.msys2.org](https://www.msys2.org)
- Then in MSYS2 terminal:
  ```bash
  pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-make

#### 4. Clone Pico SDK

```bash
git clone -b master https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk.git
cd pico-sdk
git submodule update --init
```

___5. SET ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE:___

```bash
set PICO_SDK_PATH=path\to\pico-sdk
```

---

### Linux / macOS

#### 1. Install ARM GCC

Ubuntu/Debian:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install gcc-arm-none-eabi
```

macOS:

```bash
brew tap ArmMbed/homebrew-formulae
brew install arm-none-eabi-gcc
```

#### 2. Install CMake + Ninja (optional)

```bash
sudo apt install cmake ninja-build
# or
brew install cmake ninja
```

#### 3. Clone Pico SDK

```bash
git clone -b master https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk.git
cd pico-sdk
git submodule update --init
```

Set environment variable:

```bash
export PICO_SDK_PATH=/full/path/to/pico-sdk
```

## How to Build (Multiple Environments)

This project supports multiple build systems using CMake. The `-DPICO_BOARD=pico` flag is used to select the board version. The `CMakeLists.txt` files in this project are configured so that the build outputs flash files for both the server and the client separately, each in its own folder.

### Build with **NMake Makefiles** (recommended for Windows + Visual Studio)

```bash
mkdir build
cd build

# Create separate folders for each board type
mkdir build_pico2_w
cd build_pico2_w
cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" ../.. -DPICO_BOARD=pico2_w
nmake
cd..

mkdir build_pico
cd build_pico
cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" ../.. -DPICO_BOARD=pico
nmake
```

Each board type now has its own build folder, containing both the client and server firmware ready to be flashed.

### Build with **Ninja** (cross-platform, fast builds)

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
mkdir build_pico
cd build_pico
cmake -G "Ninja" ../.. -DPICO_BOARD=pico
ninja
```

### Build with **Unix Makefiles** (Linux/macOS)

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
mkdir build_pico
cd build_pico
cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" ../.. -DPICO_BOARD=pico
make
```

### Build with **MinGW Makefiles** (Windows)

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
mkdir build_pico
cd build_pico
cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" ../.. -DPICO_BOARD=pico
mingw32-make
```

## Flashing to Raspberry Pi Pico

### Option 1: Drag-and-drop (BOOTSEL mode)

1. Hold `BOOTSEL` while plugging in the Pico via USB.
2. It will mount as a drive.
3. Drag the `.uf2` file onto it.

### Option 2: Use `picotool`

```bash
picotool load client.uf2/server.uf2
```

Requires:

* `picotool` installed
* Pico connected normally (not in BOOTSEL)

---

## Configuration

Edit `types.c`, `config.h` and `menu.h` to customize settings like:

* UART pin pairs and instances enabled for handshake
* UART baudrate and messages
* Client & Server handshake timeout
* Max GPIOs per client
* Enable / Disable periodic onboard led blink
* Onboard led blink periods
* Flash memory layout
* Console buffer size limit at reconnection
* etc...

---

## Design Considerations

* Uses `__not_in_flash_func` for safe Flash writes
* Handshake timeouts are adjustable
